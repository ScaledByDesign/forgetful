"""Integration tests for the UAT harness report contract (test_harness/report.py).

The walkthrough agent writes report.json in its workspace; the harness must parse it
tolerantly — a malformed or missing report is a recorded finding about the run, never a
harness crash (the eval-harness trust boundary: only harness-side defects raise).
